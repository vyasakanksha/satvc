The TwoManySat's Verifying Compiler

A simple compiler with built in formal verification for deterministic and probabilistic algorithms.

This project will hopefully grow up to become a compiler with built in formal verification. The verification is based on Hoare logic. The language for the compiler is based on a modified version of the "While Language", also owed to Hoare. The compiler will support verification for algorithms from the complexity classes P, RP and ZPP.
