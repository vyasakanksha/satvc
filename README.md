The TwoManySat's Verifying Compiler

A simple compiler with built in formal verification for deterministic and 
randomized algorithms. It is still in teh development stages. 

The Project:
This project will hopefully grow up to become a compiler with built in formal 
verification. The verification is based on Hoare logic. The language for the 
compiler is based on a modified version of the "While Language", also owed 
to Hoare. The compiler will support verification for algorithms from the 
complexity classes P, RP and ZPP. 

The Name:
When I first started working with software verification I spent a lot of time
messing around with different algorithms for the 2Sat problem to study
verification techniques. The problem has been with me right from the beginning
and has played a significant role in shaping this project. And at this point, I am
quite sick of all things 2SAT. It has thus inspired the name of this compiler.
